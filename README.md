5. Create a conceptual model for the available dataset and create Entity Relationship Diagram. (ERD) 

6. Implement the data model (physical design) using SSIS packages. 

7. Create dimensions and facts tables using OLAP cubes for quick retival of data.

8. Create a dashboard using tableau to get out insignts from the data.
